# Things I would do or do better with more time

- General refactoring and splitting components in separate files
- Pagination/infinite scroll for the products
- Better filters (forgot a button as well, I guess to confirm the filter selection)
- Missing button in the header
- The products in the cart to have slightly different style than the products in the shop (smaller image, less details)
- Show the total in the cart
- Use the actual icons (they are separate vectors in Figma, which is something I wouldn't have in a real use case)
- Light and subtle animations for user feedback (cart drawer sliding in and out)

# Full disclosure

I used a template to kickstart the project, instructions to run it are below.

# Redux Toolkit TypeScript Example

This example shows how to integrate Next.js with [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org).

The **Redux Toolkit** is a standardized way to write Redux logic (create actions and reducers, setup the store with some default middlewares like redux devtools extension). This example demonstrates each of these features with Next.js

## Deploy your own

Deploy the example using [Vercel](https://vercel.com?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=next-example):
